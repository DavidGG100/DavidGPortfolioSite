									<h3>How do games foster creative thinking within its players, and how important is it that a game does so? </h3>
									<h4>Abstract</h4>
									<p>Creativity and learning are a fundamental part of video games. In order to provide meaningful and satisfying challenges to players, games often require players to have the ability to think creatively about solutions for the challenges they face. However, it is crucial for a game to be able to foster that ability into its players, as a failure to do so will result in a frustrating experience for the player as can be seen in Kingdom Hearts 3 Re:Mind’s Limit Cut and Secret Episodes. Games tend to foster creative thinking within players through the use of operant conditioning, with the most favorable form of operant conditioning being positive reinforcement. This means that the ideal way to foster creativity within players is by rewarding them with progression for successfully displaying creative thinking, which is perfectly exemplified in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. With that being said, applying creative thinking in order to overcome challenges is not the only way a game can provide players with meaningful and satisfying experiences. Multiplayer First Person Shooters are able to provide meaningful experiences to 3 out of Richard Bartle’s 4 player types without the need to foster and apply creative thinking. These findings indicate that in order to design a memorable challenge for players, game designers need to foster creative thinking into them, which will in turn make for a satisfying experience as they apply the creative thinking they learned into the game’s challenges. However, that is not the only way to provide a memorable gameplay experience, as it is still possible for games to provide such an experience through the appeal to socializing, competition between players, and achievements.</p>
